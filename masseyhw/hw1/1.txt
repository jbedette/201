Computer Systems Programming, Homework #1
Typing speed game
You are to implement a game that tests a user's typing speed. The game
randomly chooses words from an array of strings containing "The", "quick",
"brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog". Each word must appear
exactly once. The program should output the time it takes for the user to
correctly enter the entire array of words. If the user incorrectly types a word,
the program must prompt the user to retype the incorrect word.
Rules and requirements
Random permutation of words should be generated via calls to srand()
and rand()
Seed srand() using the usec ﬁeld from a call to gettimeofday().
Each permutation of the words must be possible.
Ensure that your random permutation is generated using a minimal
number of rand() calls
Hint: A modulus that decreases for each word selected is
suﬀicient for full credit
Use timer macro "timersub()" for handling operations on struct
timevals (/usr/include/sys/time.h)
In case you are using c99, using timersub will generate an error. You
must add the following line before all other #include lines to bypass
it. #deﬁne _BSD_SOURCE
Timing should begin when the random permutation is ﬁrst given
to the user
Timing should end when the user correctly inputs the
permutation correctly.
Hints and suggestions
Consult the linux man pages for more information on rand()/srand(),
gettimeofday(), timersub(), printf()/scanf(), strlen(), strncmp() etc.
Once you have read in the input line, you will want to ﬂush the rest of
the line. Here is a small piece of code that reads in 10 characters of
input and then throws away the rest of the line.
scanf("%10s", word);
while((c = getchar()) != '\n' && c != EOF)
;
/* discard */

This is a game that tests typing speed
Type the following words:
word #1 is fox: foxy
Incorrect. Try again.
word #1 is fox: fo
Incorrect. Try again.
word #1 is fox: fox
word #2 is The: The
word #3 is brown: brown
word #4 is lazy: lazy
word #5 is jumped: jumped
word #6 is over: over
word #7 is quick: quick
word #8 is dog: dog
word #9 is the: the
Correct! Your time is: 20 sec and 222855 usec
